# rpiwebapp

This is the programmer web app for the Protothrottle Receiver Module. 

It is based on the python web framework Flask and is intented to be installed on a 
RaspberryPi Zero W with a USB connected Xbee configured with the X24C 802.15.4 TH firmware.

Note that this is only the web app itself, you will still need to first download and burn an image.
The image contains all of the configuration to turn the RaspPiZW into a wireless access point that
talks Protothrottle Xbee.

You can find that image here at http://blueridgeengineering.net/rpinetwork.zip
It requires a 16GB microSD card. Burn the above image to it and power up the RPiZW.
It is a complete install and contains the UI if you wish to use it that way.

I won't put the console/root password in this README but if you get this far, just email me:
